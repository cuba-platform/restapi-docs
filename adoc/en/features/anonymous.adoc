=== Anonymous Access

By default, anonymous access is disabled. To enable it, use the <<cuba.rest.anonymousEnabled, cuba.rest.anonymousEnabled>> application property. A request is considered to be anonymous if it doesn't contain an `Authentication` header. In this case, the {manual}/securityContext.html[SecurityContext] will contain an anonymous user session.

To set up permissions for anonymous user you must define {manual}/roles.html[roles] for the user specified by the {manual}/app_properties_reference.html#cuba.anonymousLogin[cuba.anonymousLogin] application property.
