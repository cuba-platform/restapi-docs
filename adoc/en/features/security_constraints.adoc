=== Security Constraints for Collection Attributes

Let's consider the following situation:

* Your data model contains `Order` and `OrderLine` entities which form the one-to-many composition.

* Your REST client loads an instance of `Order` together with the nested collection of `OrderLine` instances.

* There are {manual}/constraints.html[security constraints] that filter out some `OrderLine` instances, so the client does not load them and doesn't know they exist. Say `line5` is not loaded by the client but exists in the database.

* If your client removes, say, `line2` from the collection and then saves the whole composition using the `/entities/{entityName}/{entityId}` endpoint, there are two outcomes:
+
--
. If the constraints were not changed since the entities were loaded, the framework restores the filtered `line5` instance in the collection and deletes only `line2`, which is the correct behavior.

. If the constraints were changed in a way that `line5` is now available to the client, the framework cannot restore the information about filtered collection elements correctly. As a result, both `line2` and `line5` will be deleted.
--

If you are concerned with the case described above, you can eliminate possible data loss by sending a special system attribute in the JSON representing your entities. This attribute is called `+__securityToken+` and automatically included in resulting JSON if the <<cuba.rest.requiresSecurityToken,cuba.rest.requiresSecurityToken>> application property is set to `true`. The responsibility of your REST client is to return this attribute back when saving entities.

An example of entity JSON including security token:

[source, json]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/features/securityToken.json[]
----

The `+__securityToken+` attribute contains encoded identifiers of filtered instances, so the framework can always restore the required information regardless of changes in constraints.
