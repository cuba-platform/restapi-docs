== Security Implications When Using REST API

Generic REST API provides powerful means to deal with arbitrary data from domain model without manual endpoints creation. However, if you enable the REST API in your application, you must configure security (Roles/Access Groups) and always keep it in actual state on a production system in order to prevent access to some sensitive data.

Here are some rules you should follow when the REST API is turned on:

* Always disable access to the REST API for roles/users which are not supposed to use it.
* Use deny-by-default strategy: always assign DENYING role to users which have access to the REST API. Project model changes over time - itâ€™s easy to miss adding granular restrictions.
* Always configure and assign constraints (by access groups) for non-common entities to the REST API users.
* Consider using secure implementation of data manager (obtained via `DataManager::secure()`) in middleware services exposed to the REST API. Remember that EntityManager does not impose security restrictions.
* Remember that entity attributes are not restricted by default even in case of DENYING Role. Setup permissions for each entity attribute individually.
* Specify custom <<cuba.rest.client.secret,client secret>> on production.

If you have troubles configuring fine-grained security for your project consider using custom endpoints instead of REST API.
