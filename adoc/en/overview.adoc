== Overview

The add-on provides a universal REST API with the following functionality:

* CRUD operations on entities.
* Execution of predefined JPQL queries.
* Execution of service methods.
* Getting metadata (entities, views, enumerations, datatypes).
* Getting current user permissions (access to entities, attributes, specific permissions).
* Getting current user information (name, language, time zone, etc.).
* Uploading and downloading files.

REST API uses the OAuth2 protocol for authentication and supports anonymous access.

All REST API endpoints work with data according to the authenticated user permissions set in {manual}/security_subsystem.html[security subsystem].
