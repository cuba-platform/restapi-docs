== Overview

The universal REST API provides the following functionality:

* CRUD operations on entities.
* Execution of predefined JPQL queries.
* Execution of service methods.
* Getting metadata (entities, views, enumerations, datatypes).
* Getting current user permissions (access to entities, attributes, specific permissions).
* Getting current user information (name, language, time zone, etc.).
* Uploading and downloading files.

REST API uses the OAuth2 protocol for authentication and supports anonymous access.

**The detailed documentation of the API endpoints:** {rest_swagger_url}.

The <<usage_example>> section contains a lot of examples demonstrating REST API features in action. Below we provide a formal description of some features and configuration options.
