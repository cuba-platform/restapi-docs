*REST API* add-on will be installed in your project.

Keep in mind that the add-on is built only for the framework version 7.1 and above. In the earlier versions REST API was included in the core framework.

=== Testing Basic Functionality
+
--
* In Studio, you should see the *REST* element in the CUBA project tree after Gradle refresh is completed.

* Start the application and test the REST API using `curl` command line tool:

. Request OAuth token:
+
----
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/oauth/token \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic Y2xpZW50OnNlY3JldA==' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'grant_type=password&username=admin&password=admin'
----
+
You will get a JSON response with some `access_token` value. Use it for further requests in the `Authorization` header.

. Request the list of roles (replace `<access_token>` with the value obtained on the previous step):
+
----
  curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/entities/sec$Role' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'
----
+
The response will contain all registered roles, provided that the user for which the token was obtained has permissions to read the `sec$Role` entity.
