*REST API* add-on will be installed in your project.

Keep in mind that the add-on is built only for the framework version 7.1 and above. In the earlier versions REST API was included in the core framework.

=== Testing Basic Functionality
--
* You should see the *REST* element in the CUBA project tree after Gradle refresh is completed in Studio.

* Configure security according to <<security,Security>> section:

** Create a role that includes `cuba.restApi.enabled` specific permission and grants permissions to read the required entities and attributes.
** Assign the created role to the user.

* Start the application and test the REST API using the `curl` command-line tool:

. <<rest_api_v2_ex_get_token,Request OAuth token>>:
+
----
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/oauth/token \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic Y2xpZW50OnNlY3JldA==' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'grant_type=password&username=admin&password=admin'
----
+
You will get a JSON response with some `access_token` value. Use it for further requests in the `Authorization` header.

. <<rest_api_v2_ex_get_entities_list,Request the list of roles>> (replace `<access_token>` with the value obtained on the previous step):
+
----
  curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/entities/sec$Role' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'
----
+
The response will contain all registered roles, provided that the user for which the token was obtained has permissions to read the `sec$Role` entity.
