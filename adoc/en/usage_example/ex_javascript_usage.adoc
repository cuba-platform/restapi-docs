=== JavaScript Usage Example

This section contains an example of using REST API v2 from JavaScript running on a HTML page. The page initially shows login form, and after successful login displays a message and a list of entities.

For simplicity, we will use `modules/web/web/VAADIN` folder for storing HTML/CSS/JavaScript files, as the corresponding folder in the deployed web application is used for serving static resources by default. So you will not need to make any configuration of your Tomcat application server. The resulting URL will start from `++http://localhost:8080/app/VAADIN++`, so do not use this approach in a real world application - create a separate web application with its own context instead.

Download https://jquery.com/download[jQuery] and http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download[Bootstrap] and copy to `modules/web/web/VAADIN` folder of your project. Create `customers.html` and `customers.js` files, so the content of the folder should look as follows:

[source, plain]
----
bootstrap.min.css
customers.html
customers.js
jquery-3.1.1.min.js
----

`customers.html` file content:

[source, html]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/rest_customers.html[]
----

`customers.js` file content:

[source, javascript]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/rest_customers_script.js[]
----

Login and password from the user input are sent to the server by the POST request with the Base64-encoded client credentials in the `Authorization` header as explained in <<rest_api_v2_ex_get_token>> section. If the authentication is successful, the web page receives an access token value from the server, the token is stored in the `oauthToken` variable, the `loginForm` div is hidden and the `loggedInStatus` div is shown.

To show the list of customers, the request is sent to the server <<rest_api_v2_ex_get_entities_list,to get the instances>> of the `sales$Customer` entity, passing the `oauthToken` value in the `Authorization` header.

In case the request is processed successfully, the `customers` div is shown, and the `customersList` element is filled with items containing customer names and emails.
