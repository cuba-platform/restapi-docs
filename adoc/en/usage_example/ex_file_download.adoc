[[rest_api_v2_ex_file_download]]
=== Files Downloading

When {rest_swagger_url}/#!/Files/get_files_id[downloading a file], passing a security token in the request header is often inconvenient. It is desirable to have a URL for downloading that may be put to the *src* attribute of the *img* tag.

As a solution, an <<rest_api_v2_ex_get_token,OAuth token>> can also be passed in the request URL as a parameter with the *access_token* name.

For example, an image is uploaded to the application. Its FileDescriptor id is `44809679-e81c-e5ae-dd81-f56f223761d6`.

In this case a URL for downloading the image will look like this:

`\http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/files/44809679-e81c-e5ae-dd81-f56f223761d6?access_token=a2f0bb4e-773f-6b59-3450-3934cbf0a2d6`
