=== New Entity Instance Creation

New `sales$Order` entity instance can be created with the *POST* request on the address:

`\http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/entities/sales$Order`

An OAuth token must be put in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` type.

The request body must contain a JSON object that describes a new entity instance, e.g.:

[source, json]

include::{sourcesdir}/rest-create-order-request.json[]
----

Below is an example of https://curl.haxx.se/[cURL] POST request that creates a new `Order` instance:

[source, plain]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/rest_api_v2_ex_create_entity.txt[]
----

A collection of order items (`items`) and a `customer` reference are passed in the request body. Let's examine how these attributes will be processed.

First, let's have a quick look to the `Order` class:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/features/Order.java[]
----

The `items` collection property is annotated with the {manual}/entity_attr_annotations.html#composition_annotation[@Composition]. REST API methods for entity creation and update will create a new entity instances for all members of such collections. In our case, two instances of `OrderItem` entity will be created with the `Order` entity.

The `customer` reference doesn't have a `@Composition` annotation, that's why the REST API will try to find a client with the given id and set it to the `customer` field. If the client is not found then an order won't be created and the method will return an error.

In case of successful method execution a full object graph of the created entity is returned:
