=== REST API Authentication with LDAP

LDAP Authentication for REST can be enabled using the following properties:

* `cuba.rest.ldap.enabled` - whether LDAP authentication is enabled or not.

* `cuba.rest.ldap.urls` – LDAP server URL.

* `cuba.rest.ldap.base` – base DN for user search.

* `cuba.rest.ldap.user` – the distinguished name of a system user which has the right to read the information from the directory.

* `cuba.rest.ldap.password` – the password for the system user defined in the {manual}/app_properties_reference.html#cuba.web.ldap.user[cuba.web.ldap.user] property.

* `cuba.rest.ldap.userLoginField` - the name of an LDAP user attribute that is used for matching the login name. `sAMAccountName` by default (suitable for Active Directory).

Example of {manual}/app_properties_files.html[local.app.properties] file:

[source, properties]
----
cuba.rest.ldap.enabled = true
cuba.rest.ldap.urls = ldap://192.168.1.1:389
cuba.rest.ldap.base = ou=Employees,dc=mycompany,dc=com
cuba.rest.ldap.user = cn=System User,ou=Employees,dc=mycompany,dc=com
cuba.rest.ldap.password = system_user_password
----

You can obtain OAuth token using the following end-point:

`\http://localhost:8080/app/rest/v2/ldap/token`

An access to this endpoint is protected with the basic authentication. REST API client identifier and password are used for basic authentication. Please note that these are not the application user login and password. REST API client id and password are defined in the application properties <<cuba.rest.client.id, cuba.rest.client.id>> and <<cuba.rest.client.secret, cuba.rest.client.secret>> (the default values are `client` and `secret`). You must pass the client id and secret, separated by a single colon (":") character, within a base64 encoded string in the `Authorization` header.

Request parameters are the same as for standard authentication:

* `grant_type` - always `password`.
* `username` - application user login.
* `password` - application user password.

The request type must be `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, the encoding is `UTF-8`.

Also, standard authentication with login and password can be disabled:
